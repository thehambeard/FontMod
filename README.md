## Font Mod for Owlcat's WH40KRT

![screenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thehambeard/FontMod/refs/heads/master/screenShot.png)

Place fonts in the mod's font folder. 

%user%\AppData\LocalLow\Owlcat Games\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\UnityModManager\FontMod\Fonts.

Ctrl+F10 to open UMM menu.  You can map multiple fonts to be used for different in-game fonts.  I didn't feel like data mining the whole game for every font so if you come across new fonts in the game it will automatically add them to the game fonts.  
These are saved in encounteredFonts.json. default is the font that will be used if nothing is mapped to the in-game font. If you want to change evert font in the game to the same font then only having default set will do that.  The mod automatically selects the first mod
loaded to be the default when first run. The mappings are kept in fontMappings.json.
